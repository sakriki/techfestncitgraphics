# YouTube Thumbnail Collage

This project is a single image showcasing a collection of 10 to 20 YouTube thumbnails, all designed by me, Saksham Jaiswal. Each thumbnail in the collage was created with attention to detail and creativity to make them visually appealing and engaging.

This collage is submitted as part of a graphic design competition to demonstrate my skills and passion for creating eye-catching YouTube thumbnails.
